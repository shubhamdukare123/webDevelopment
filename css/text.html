   <h1>Avengers</h1>
   <hr>
    <p>The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently from the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.

        The concept of the Avengers was teased in the post-credits scene of Iron Man (2008), the first MCU film, by Nick Fury as an initiative created by him. The concept was further explored in Iron Man 2 (2010), with the introduction of Natasha Romanoff. The team was eventually established in the crossover-style film The Avengers (2012), which, followed by Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), established a series of four films that headlined the MCU and is currently the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all time, grossing more than USD$7.7 billion. Endgame became the highest grossing film of all time in July 2019, passing Avatar (2009), but Avatar took the title back after a re-release in China in March 2021. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, they are central to the MCU's first 23 films, which is collectively known as the Infinity Saga, and have been acclaimed as an important part of the franchise. The Avengers from alternate universes made appearances during Phase Four of the MCU in multiple episodes of the first season of the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021â€“present).
        
        The Avengers have received praise as a group from critics, with Endgame called a perfect conclusion for that iteration of the team. Due to their popularity, Avengers Campus, a series of attractions at various Disney Parks, opened in June 2021 at Disney California Adventure. The Avengers are set to return in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.

    <h3>The Avengers Initiative</h3>
        <p>In 1995, the Avengers Initiative is created by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who envisions a group of heroes working together in response to planetary threats, following the appearance of superhumans such as Carol Danvers. He names his plan after her U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".[1][2] Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for the initiative, including Tony Stark[3] and Steve Rogers.[4] Stark's membership is declined after a negative report on his suitability by Natasha Romanoff.[5] The World Security Council expresses a desire for Emil Blonsky to join the initiative, although they abandon their wish after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea, instead bringing in Bruce Banner.[6]</p>
