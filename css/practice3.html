        Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from React. The central idea is that you build your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. When a widget’s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to the next.V

        When writing an app, you’ll commonly author new widgets that are subclasses of either StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget, depending on whether your widget manages any state. A widget’s main job is to implement a build() function, which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying RenderObject, which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.
